<h1> CS303E Homework 1</h1>
<h2> Instructor: Dr. Bill Young<br>
Due Date: Friday, January 29, 2021 at 11:59pm</h2>

<h3> Starting Programming in Python </h3>

Your task is to write a program that prints your initials in large
letters.  For example, if your name were "Thomas Alva Edison," you
would print T.A.E. as shown below.  If your name has less than 3
initials, pad on the right with X's.  For example, if your initials
are BY, you should display B.Y.X.  If you have more than 3 initials,
you can give them all or stop at 3; that's your choice.
<pre>
  TTTTTTTTTTTT          AAAA          EEEEEEEEEEEE
  TTTTTTTTTTTT          AAAA          EEEEEEEEEEEE
       TT              AA  AA         EE
       TT              AA  AA         EE
       TT             AAAAAAAA        EEEEEEEEEEEE
       TT             AAAAAAAA        EEEEEEEEEEEE
       TT            AA      AA       EE
       TT            AA      AA       EE
       TT       ..  AA        AA  ..  EEEEEEEEEEEE  ..
       TT       ..  AA        AA  ..  EEEEEEEEEEEE  ..

</pre>

Note that the big "T" is made of little "T"s, and so on. Each letter
should be 12 characters wide and 10 lines high.  The width of each
line should be 2 characters.  Each letter should be followed by a
period, drawn using four "." characters, as shown above.  There should
be two empty columns of spaces to the left and to the right of each
letter and period (including the final period).  Also, there should be
an empty line at the top and one at the bottom.  <i>Make sure that you
follow these directions exactly.  Last semester most of the points
lost were lost because of failure to do that!  If you have extra
spaces or extra columns, you will lose points.</i>  One of the most
important lessons in computing is being able to follow a specification
precisely.<p>

<b>Note:</b> This assignment is only about printing some text; you
  don't have to generate each letter with a program or anything
  complicated like that.  Just create them using your text editor, put
  a <tt>print</tt> statement around each line, and assemble the print
  statements into a program.  Of course, make sure you test your
  program before you submit it.</p><p>

</p><h3>Turning in the Assignment:</h3>

The program should be in a file named <tt>Initials.py</tt>.  Submit
the file via Canvas before the deadline shown at the top of this page.
Submit it to the assignment <tt>weekly-hw1</tt> under
the <tt>assignments</tt> sections by uploading your python file.<p>

Your file must compile and run before submission.  It must also
contain a header with the following format:</p><p>

</p><pre># File: Initials.py
# Student: 
# UT EID:
# Course: CS303E
# 
# Date Created:
# Date Last Modified: 
# Description of Program: 
</pre>
The Description of the Program should be a few sentences describing
what it does, so that someone can understand what your program does
without reading the code.  <i>Don't write a book!  This is only to say
what it does, not how it's programmed in any detail.</i>

<p>
If you submit multiple times to Canvas, it will rename your file name
to something like <tt>Initials-2.py</tt>, <tt>Initials-3.py</tt>, etc.
Don't worry about that; we'll grade the latest version.
